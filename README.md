The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in schools shut all across the world. Globally, over 1.2 billion children are out of the classroom. As a result, education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. Research suggests that online learning has been shown to increase retention of information, and take less time, meaning the changes coronavirus have caused might be here to stay. 
The KEF Discussion Forum that we are building will serve as a free platform for students to discuss their academic doubts. Any student or teacher can answer these doubts, one just needs to create an account using their e-mail address. Viewing questions and answers will not require sign-in.

This platform will also serve as a centralized platform for revision, as revising previously asked doubts is one of the best ways to never forget a concept.

Another feature of our platform will be analytics. This page will show a leaderboard, which will make it possible to know which students or teachers are answering/asking the most doubts, and which subjects are asked more frequently. Time given to these subjects in regular classes can be adjusted accordingly.

Another possible feature is the ability to upvote/downvote answers for registered users, which in turn will improve the analytics feature.
